                            I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.

                    <small class="side scont">"Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
                        professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs
                        who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were
                        very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding.
                        It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it
                        during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer
                        after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"
